## WeaS
Weas stands for weather & security for our user's concern, which takes up a little space beside the door but can offer meaningful functions for your life.

People likely tend to forget to check about weather conditions for the day and thus can lead to embarrassments like stuck in the rain and dress less warm than needed. The thing is we don't have the habit to check weather forecast deliberately, but what we do is putting on sneakers, boots or leather shoes by the door when we heading out. We want to utilize the several seconds we spent on the shoes to inform our user about today's weather condition. The obvious red LED light on the weather forecast indicates today is or will be raining/snowing which could suggest our user check the LCD screen for more detailed info about today's weather. If the weather gonna be great today the peaceful green LED light will replace the red light.

Sometimes when we are out of the house, we would probably worry about our possession's safety. Our WeaS house guardian function will take care of the security concern for you. There are two modes for the house guardian, safe mode & security mode. In the security mode, if someone wants to break into the room without your permission, WeaS will detect that person, trigger the alarm and inform you via text messages. You can switch these two modes using the select buttons we provide you. What if we forget to set security mode when we leave the house? We can always set the mode using text messages and if setting successful you will get a confirmation text message from WeaS. One thing to notice: if the alarm has been triggered, these select buttons will be disabled so the alarm won't stop until you text WeaS.
